INTRODUCTION
------------

    This library provides an implementation of the EBU recommendation 128 -
    "Loudness normalization and permitted maximum level of audio signals."

    This is an initial release, and there are certainly bugs and potential for
    improvement. Please report bugs and suggestions to labs@radionova.no.

    Please study the information on http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness for more information.

    Note: We have no affiliation to EBU organization.


WHAT IS THIS AND WHAT IS IT USED FOR?
-------------------------------------

    This library does analysis of audio and gives a number representing the loudness
    of the audio. It can be used both for live metering (typically for broadcasting)
    and offline analyze of audio files (typically normalising ala Replay Gain). 

    The EBU recommends normalizing audio to -23LUFS.

    The library is provided as source with example programs. It's tested with GCC on
    Linux, but porting to other platforms should be fairly easy.
    


DEPENDENCIES
------------

    Recent versions of libavformat-dev and libavcodec-dev (for example program only)



INSTALLATION
------------

    make

    this will compile the library and example programs. 



EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
----------------

wave_analyze:
use: ./wave_analyze <filename.wav> [ebu_mode (m,s,i)]
    - Only analyzes Wave/PCM files 
    - Defaults to EBU MODE i as default


ffmpeg_analyze:
use: ./ffmpeg_analyze <filename> [ebu_mode (m,s,i) [audiostream_id] ]
    - Will analyze any file that ffmpeg/libavcodec is capable of decoding
    - If more than 1 audio tracks, it automatically selects the first. 
    - If you like to analyze a different track, set the ebu_mode and audiostream_id  
      (useful for transport streams with both stereo and 5.1 tracks)
